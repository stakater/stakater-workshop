## Extend Tekton Pipeline with Automated Testing

> In this exercise we'll deploy Allure - a useful tool for managing your java tests and other reports from your CI/CD server. The exercise is in two parts: first we'll deploy Allure using gitOps and then add the tests to our pipeline

### Part 1 - Allure 

1. For this exercise, we will use a tool called **Allure**.
    ```

2. Open the `nordmart-apps-gitops-config` and navigate to `01-<TENANT_NAME> > 00-argocd-apps > 01-dev`

3. Add the following argocd application and commit the changes.
```
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: <TENANT_NAME>-dev-allure
      namespace: openshift-gitops
      labels:
        stakater.com/tenant: <TENANT_NAME>
        stakater.com/env: dev
        stakater.com/kind: dev         
    spec:
      destination:
        namespace: <TENANT_NAME>-dev
        server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
      project: sorcerers 
      source:
        path: stakater/allure
        repoURL: 'https://github.com/stakater/charts.git'
        targetRevision: HEAD
      syncPolicy:
        automated:
          prune: true
          selfHeal: true

```

4. Now head over to argocd and refresh <TENANT_NAME>-dev application. You should be able to see allure resources being deployed

    ![allure-argocd](./images/allure-argocd.png)

You should see the Allure UI come up in a few moments after ArgoCD syncs it. You can browse the default project on Allure to verify it's up and running 

```bash
echo https://$(oc get route <TENANT_NAME>-dev-allure --template='{{ .spec.host }}' -n ${TENANT_NAME}-dev)/allure-docker-service/projects/default/reports/latest/index.html
```

### Part 2 - Testing Tasks

> In this part, we will add a unit test to our pipeline and then send the results to allure.

1. Open the Chart we added to 00-tekton-pipelines folder in section 2.
![images/pipelines-nordmart-apps-gitops-config](images/pipelines-nordmart-apps-gitops-config.png)` folder.

2. Open the values file in the editor. After the ` stakater-sonarqube-scanner-v1`, reference the unit test task and add a runAfter field to make it run after the  stakater-sonarqube-scanner-v1 task:

```yaml
- defaultTaskName: stakater-unit-test-v1
  runAfter:
    - stakater-sonarqube-scanner-v1
```
Also add the stakater-gitlab-save-allure-report-v1 after the unit test task
```yaml
- defaultTaskName: stakater-gitlab-save-allure-report-v1
```

2. The pipeline will become:

   ```yaml
   pipeline-charts:
     name: stakater-main-pr-v1
     workspaces:
     - name: source
       volumeClaimTemplate:
         accessModes: ReadWriteOnce
         resourcesRequestsStorage: 1Gi
     pipelines:
       tasks:
         - defaultTaskName: git-clone
         - defaultTaskName: stakater-create-git-tag-v1
         - defaultTaskName: stakater-sonarqube-scanner-v1
           runAfter:
             - stakater-create-git-tag-v1
         - defaultTaskName: stakater-unit-test-v1
           runAfter: 
             - stakater-sonarqube-scanner-v1
         - defaultTaskName: stakater-gitlab-save-allure-report-v1
         - defaultTaskName: stakater-buildah-v1
           name: build-and-push
           params:
             - name: BUILD_IMAGE
               value: "true"
         - defaultTaskName: stakater-helm-push-v1
         - defaultTaskName: stakater-create-environment-v1
         - defaultTaskName: stakater-gitlab-update-cd-repo-v1
           params: 
             - name: gitlab_group
         - defaultTaskName: stakater-push-main-tag-v1
     triggertemplate:
           serviceAccountName: stakater-workshop-tekton-builder
           pipelineRunNamePrefix: $(tt.params.repoName)-$(tt.params.prnumberBranch)
           params:
             - name: repoName
             - name: prnumberBranch
               default: "main"
     eventlistener:
           serviceAccountName: stakater-workshop-tekton-builder
           triggers:
           - name: gitlab-mergerequest-create
             bindings:
               - ref: stakater-gitlab-merge-request-v1
               - name: oldcommit
                 value: "NA"
               - name: newcommit
                 value: $(body.object_attributes.last_commit.id)
           - name: gitlab-mergerequest-synchronize
             bindings:
               - ref: stakater-gitlab-merge-request-v1
               - name: oldcommit
                 value: $(body.object_attributes.oldrev)
               - name: newcommit
                 value: $(body.object_attributes.last_commit.id)
           - name: gitlab-push
             bindings:
               - name: newcommit
                 value: $(body.after)
               - name: oldcommit
                 value: $(body.before)
               - ref: stakater-gitlab-push-v1
     rbac:
       enabled: false
     serviceAccount:
       name: stakater-workshop-tekton-builder
       create: false
        
   ```

4. Commit the changes.


5. Now open Argocd and check if the changes were synchronized. Click refresh if argocd has not synced the changes yet.

![allure](./images/allure-argocd.png)

Open up the console and navigate to your pipeline definition by going to `Pipelines` and selecting your pipeline from the list. You should see a unit tast and allure task there as well.

![allure-pipeline](./images/allure-pipeline.png)

6. If the sync is green, you're good to go. You have successfully added automated to your pipeline!

7. Now make a small change on the nordmart-review application to trigger the pipeline. Head over to the console and check the running pipeline. You should be able to see unit test and allure task running.

![allure-running](./images/allure-running.png)

8. Once the task completes, head over to `allure` by opening the link returned by the below command. Don't forget to change the <TENANT_NAME>!

```bash
echo https://$(oc get route <TENANT_NAME>-dev-allure --template='{{ .spec.host }}' -n ${TENANT_NAME}-dev)/allure-docker-service/projects/stakater-nordmart-review/reports/latest/index.html
```

CONGRATULATION!!! You have added automated testing to your pipeline.
