# KubeLinter

> KubeLinter is an open source tool that analyzes Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts, checking them against a variety of best practices, with a focus on production readiness and security.

## Task

#### SAAP KubeLinter:

SAAP cluster is shipped with a `kube-lint` task that uses KubeLinter and Helm to verify the YAML files. We will be using this task to integrate KubeLinter in our pipeline.


1. To view the already defined SonarQube cluster task, open up the `Pipelines` section from the left menu and click `Tasks`

The KubeLinter tasks has two steps:
* `helm` - this step uses Helm template and Helm dry run to check the Helm chart files.

* `kube-lint` - this step uses `kube-lint` to analyse the Kubernetes yaml files.
